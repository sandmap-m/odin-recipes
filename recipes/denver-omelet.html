    <h2>Delicous Denver Omelet</h2>
    <p>
      The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known
      for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods
      I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a
      complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.
