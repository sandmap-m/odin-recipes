    <h2>Delicous Denver Omelet</h2>
    <p>
      The Denver omelet is a change of pace from a French omelet and is known
      for its firmer texture and caramelized flavor. It's one of the first foods
      I learned to cook professionally as a line cook in high school. Make it a
      complete lunch or dinner with arugula salad and toasted bread.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> cup diced smoked ham</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat</li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell
        pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften
        and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula
        while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.
        Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet. Sprinkle Cheddar cheese
        and cayenne pepper over omelet
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not
        runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and
        transfer it to a plate
