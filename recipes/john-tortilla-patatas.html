    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes or russet potatoes, peeled</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>5 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/ <sub>4</sub> teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> cup olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice potatoes and onions with a very sharp knife or mandoline into
        1/8-inch thick slices
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine eggs, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper, and cayenne in a large
        bowl and whisk very thoroughly; set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1/3 cup olive oil to a large nonstick pan and set heat to
        medium-high. Add potatoes, onions, and remaining salt. Cook, tossing and
        stirring occasionally, until potatoes are tender, and some onions and
        potatoes are lightly browned, about 20 minutes. Between stirrings, cover
        potatoes to reduce cooking time and keep in moisture. For less browning,
        reduce heat to medium
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir potato mixture into egg mixture with a spatula. Cover and let stand
        for 5 to 10 minutes
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining olive oil to an 8- or 9-inch nonstick pan, and set the pan
        over medium-high heat. Pour in egg and potato mixture, and smooth the
        top. Cook, covered, for about 4 minutes or until the bottom is browned
        and the edges of tortilla begin to firm up
      </li>
      <li>
        Slide tortilla out onto a plate, cover with another plate, and flip the
        plates over to invert. Slide tortilla back into the pan, and place back
        over medium-high heat
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, uncovered, until the tortilla is fully set, about 2 minutes more.
        Tortilla will spring back lightly when pressed in the middle with a
        finger if eggs are fully cooked. If it feels soft or mushy when pressed,
        cook for a few minutes more, unless you prefer the tortilla less than
        fully set
      </li>
      <li>
        Slip tortilla onto a serving plate, and serve hot, warm, or room
        temperature
      </li>
    </ol>
